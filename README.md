# Scanner_OP #

## 1. &nbsp; Canny example 1 ##
- Taken from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/01/build-kick-ass-mobile-document-scanner-just-5-minutes/
- added median blur and tweaked few parameters.
- Results are simply horrible.
- Works only for **data/ds5.jpg**.
- Transform library provided also yields the most horrible results I have ever seen.
- Run it with ```python src/ex01/canny.py --image data/ds5.jpg```
